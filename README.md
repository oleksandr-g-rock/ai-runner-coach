![AI Agent](https://img.shields.io/badge/Type-Agentic_Application-purple)

A smart, **AI-powered personal coach** for **Athletes of All Disciplines** that lives in Telegram.

It integrates with **Strava** to analyze **ANY activity** (Run, Ride, Weight Training, Ski, Hike, Yoga, etc.), tracks your athlete profile, checks real-time weather, and provides personalized training advice with a touch of "Rocky Balboa" motivation.

Built with **Python (Aiohttp)**, **PostgreSQL**, and **LLMs** orchestrated via the standard **`openai` python library** (connecting to OpenRouter) using a robust **Webhook architecture**.

## 🤖 Why is this an Agentic App?

This is not a standard chatbot with hardcoded responses. It is an **Autonomous Agent** powered by Function Calling (Tool Use).

When you send a message, the LLM doesn't just reply; it **thinks** and decides which tools to execute:
* **Decides to check context:** If you ask "Should I go for a hike today?", it autonomously calls `check_weather(city)` and `check_strava(history)` before answering.
* **Decides to save memories:** If you say "My knee hurts after squats", it calls `save_profile_info(data)` to update its long-term memory in PostgreSQL.
* **Decides to talk:** If you just say "Hi", it replies directly without invoking tools.

It acts as a reasoning engine that bridges natural language with external APIs (Strava, Open-Meteo).

## ✨ Features

* **🧠 Universal Coaching:** Uses Llama 3.3 to analyze your specific context—whether you are training for a Marathon, building muscle in the Gym, or enjoying a Ski trip.
* **🔌 Standardized AI Integration:** Built on top of the standard `from openai import OpenAI` client. This ensures high compatibility and makes it easy to switch between OpenRouter, official OpenAI, or other compatible providers.
* **🏅 Full Strava Integration:** Connects via OAuth to fetch and analyze **Any activity type** supported by Strava (not just running/cycling, but also Weight Training, Yoga, Crossfit, etc.).
* **💾 Long-term Memory:** Remembers your age, weight, injuries, PRs, and goals (stored in PostgreSQL).
* **🌤 Weather Awareness:** Automatically checks weather conditions (wind, rain, temp) for your city before suggesting an outdoor workout.
* **🗣 Voice Support:** Transcribes voice messages using Groq's Whisper API—perfect for post-workout notes. Supports Ukrainian, English, and auto-detection of other languages.
* **⚡ Webhook Architecture:** Fast, efficient, and serverless-ready (no polling).
* **🔒 Private Mode:** Includes an "Invite Code" system to restrict access to authorized users only.

## 🏗 Architecture

The bot runs as a web server (`aiohttp`) that listens for Telegram Webhooks.

1.  **User** sends a message -> **Telegram** sends a POST request to the Bot.
2.  **Bot** authenticates user (checks DB & Invite Code).
3.  **Bot** processes intent (Talk, Check Strava, Update Profile).
4.  **Bot** initializes the `OpenAI` client (pointing to OpenRouter) to decide on tool usage.
5.  **Bot** calls external tools (Open-Meteo, Strava API).
6.  **Bot** replies asynchronously.

## 🚀 Deployment (Coolify / Docker)

This project is designed to be easily deployed using **Coolify** or any Docker-based environment.

### Prerequisites

* A **Telegram Bot Token** (from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)).
* A **Strava API Application** (from [Strava Settings](https://www.strava.com/settings/api)).
* An **OpenRouter API Key** (for LLM access).
* A **PostgreSQL Database**.
* A domain with HTTPS (required for Webhooks).

### Environment Variables

Set the following variables in your deployment environment (e.g., Coolify or `.env` file):

| Variable | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `TELEGRAM_TOKEN` | Your Telegram Bot Token | `12345:ABC...` |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | Key for LLM access | `sk-or-v1-...` |
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL Connection String | `postgres://user:pass@host:5432/db` |
| `STRAVA_CLIENT_ID` | Strava App Client ID | `123456` |
| `STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET` | Strava App Client Secret | `abc12345...` |
| `BASE_URL` | **HTTPS** URL of your deployed bot | `https://my-bot.com` |
| `INVITE_CODE` | Password for new users | `RockyBalboa2026` |
| `GROQ_WHISPER_API_KEY` | Groq API Key for voice transcription | `gsk_...` |

### 🛠 Local Development

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/oleksandr-g-rock/ai-runner-coach.git](https://github.com/oleksandr-g-rock/ai-runner-coach.git)
    cd ai-runner-coach
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Set up environment:**
    Create a `.env` file and fill in the variables listed above.

4.  **Run the bot:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    *Note: For local development with webhooks, you will need a tunnel like `ngrok` to expose your localhost to the internet.*

## 🔗 Strava Setup

To make Strava login work:
1.  Go to [Strava API Settings](https://www.strava.com/settings/api).
2.  Set the **Authorization Callback Domain** to the domain of your deployed bot (e.g., `ai-coach.your-domain.com`).

## 🛡 Security (Invite System)

By default, the bot is **locked**.
1.  New users see a "Business Card" message with links to this repo.
2.  To gain access, they must send the **Invite Code** (set in `INVITE_CODE` env var) as a message.
3.  Once authorized, their ID is whitelisted in the database permanently.
